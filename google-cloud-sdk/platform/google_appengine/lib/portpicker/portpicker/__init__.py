"""Pure python code for finding unused ports on a host.

This module provides a pick_unused_port() function.
It can also be called via the command line for use in shell scripts.
When called from the command line, it takes one optional argument, which,
if given, is sent to portserver instead of portpicker's PID.
To reserve a port for the lifetime of a bash script, use $BASHPID as this
argument.

There is a race condition between picking a port and your application code
binding to it.  The use of a port server to prevent that is recommended on
loaded test hosts running many tests at a time.

If your code can accept a bound socket as input rather than being handed a
port number consider using socket.bind(('localhost', 0)) to bind to an
available port without a race condition rather than using this library.

Typical usage:
  test_port = portpicker.pick_unused_port()
